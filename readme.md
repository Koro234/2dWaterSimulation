# First use git. 2d water simulation with cellular automaton in Godot(C#)

Simulation is based on the logic of cellular automata, added state system.

LCM - Water, RCM - Block.

You can improve the speed of work by moving the UpdateMap from PhysicsProcess to Process.


The physics of the process for class WaterCellGravity was taken from this code: https://github.com/tterrasson/liquid-simulator-godot
